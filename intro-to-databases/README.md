# HOTHXII Intro to Databases
**Date:** March 2, 2025

**Teacher:** Lorelei Tang

Hi!! This workshop provides a beginner-friendly introduction to databases and MongoDB. Participants will learn what databases are, why we use them, different types of databases, and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MongoDB. The session includes a live demo to reinforce key concepts. 

Let's hop right in!

📖 Workshop Agenda
1️⃣ What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that allows efficient storage, retrieval, and management.

Think of it as a smart bookshelf 📚 that organizes and retrieves books (data) when needed.
Databases store structured and unstructured data, making it easier to manage large amounts of information.
2️⃣ Why Do We Use Databases?
Databases are essential because they:
✅ Store large amounts of data efficiently
✅ Allow fast search & retrieval of information
✅ Ensure data consistency and security
✅ Enable multiple users to access data simultaneously
✅ Power applications, from websites to enterprise systems

3️⃣ Types of Databases
There are two main types of databases:

Relational Databases (SQL) – Structured & Table-Based

Uses structured tables with predefined schemas
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server
Best for applications requiring strict structure (e.g., banking, HR systems)
NoSQL Databases – Flexible & Scalable

Stores data as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide columns
Examples: MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra
Best for applications needing flexibility (e.g., social media, IoT)
4️⃣ What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible document format (JSON-like structure) instead of tables.

Key Features:
✅ Schema-less – Documents can have different fields
✅ Scalable – Easily handles large amounts of data
✅ Fast Queries – Efficient searching and indexing
✅ Flexible Data Model – Great for applications with evolving data structures
